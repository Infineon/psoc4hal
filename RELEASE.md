# PSoC 4 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Release Notes
The PSoC 4 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides an implementation of the Hardware Abstraction Layer for the PSoC 4 family of chips. This API provides convenience methods for initializing and manipulating different hardware peripherals. Depending on the specific chip being used, not all features may be supported.

### What's Included?
This release of the PSoC 4 HAL includes support for the following drivers:
* Clock
* EZ-I2C
* GPIO
* Hardware Manager
* I2C
* PWM
* SPI
* System
* Timer
* UART
* WDT
The following HAL drivers are planned for a future release:
* ADC
* CRC
* DMA
* Flash
* I2S
* LowPower Timer (LPTimer)
* Power Management (SysPM)
* True Random Number Generator (TRNG)
The following HAL drivers are not supported on PSoC 4 as there is no hardware support:
* DAC
* PDM/PCM
* QSPI
* RTC
* SDHC
* SDIO
* USB Device

### What Changed?
#### v0.5.0
* Initial pre-production release (Clock, EZ-I2C, GPIO, Hardware Manager, I2C, PWM, SPI, System, Timer, UART, WDT)

### Supported Software and Tools
